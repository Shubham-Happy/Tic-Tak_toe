# Tic-Tac-Toe  

This is my 2nd project as a learner of web development. I have just managed to develop a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game by just using HTML, CSS, JS .  It's an ultra simple static design.

## What's in it?  
- A homepage that consists of navigation bar, video thumbnails, and the layout are super simple.
- Completely built with basic HTML, CSS, JS.

## How to check it out
1. Download the files or clone the repository.
2. Open game.html in any browser to see it in action!  

This was a fun project and a great way to start my web development journey!
